# Apex Citadels: Vision Document

## The New New Thing in Gaming (2026)

**Apex Citadels** is a **Spatial Social Sandbox Game** that merges the best mechanics from Pokémon GO (location-based discovery) and Fortnite (creative building & competitive battles) into a persistent augmented reality world.

## 🎯 Core Value Proposition

> "Every street corner is a canvas. Every city block is a battlefield. Build your legacy in the real world."

Players don't just *visit* the world—they **permanently alter** the digital layer of reality. Your creations persist for others to discover, admire, raid, or conquer.

## 🌊 Why This is a Blue Ocean Opportunity

| Traditional AR Games | Apex Citadels |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Catch & collect | Build, defend, conquer |
| Ephemeral encounters | Persistent world state |
| Single-player with social features | True multiplayer territorial warfare |
| Static POIs | Player-generated content everywhere |
| Phone-only | Cross-platform (Phone, Tablet, XR Glasses) |

3. **Cloud Anchors 2.0** - Google/Niantic infrastructure for shared AR experiences
4. **XR Glasses Mainstream** - Android XR, Meta Quest 3S, Apple Vision Pro expanding addressable market
